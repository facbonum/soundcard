# 🧠🎛️ soundcard

**A low-level soundcard emulator for real-time digital audio synthesis.**  
This project explores how early sound hardware generated unique waveforms, tone characteristics, and I/O behavior. Inspired by retro systems, it focuses on clarity, performance, and timing precision—while laying the groundwork for more interactive extensions.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Emulate classic soundcard behaviors using low-level, timing-accurate techniques
- Learn and document fundamentals of digital audio synthesis and signal processing
- Build a clean, extensible codebase for experimenting with:
  - ✅ Custom sound fonts
  - ✅ Waveform generation and modulation
  - 🚧 External control via keyboard/soundboard input
  - 🚧 Hardware-inspired knobs, sliders, or dials for live manipulation
- Maintain minimal dependencies and cross-platform compatibility

## ⚙️ Core Concepts

- Memory-mapped I/O (inspired by 8-bit and 16-bit hardware)
- Real-time waveform synthesis (square, triangle, noise, etc.)
- Timing accuracy and performance tuning
- Modular architecture for future device input
